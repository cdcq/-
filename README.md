# 矩阵计算器

（线性代数作业通）

人与动物最根本的区别是会制造和使用工具。善用计算机，拒绝做工具人。

其实就是个能进行矩阵加减乘除求逆的小工具，以后可能会不断添加功能。

MATLAB当然能做得更好，但是如果只是为了写线代作业的话一个几M的小exe就够了不是么。



# Matrix Calculation 

( Linear algebra homework helper )

The most fundamental importance between human and animals is the ability of making and using tools.

Use computer well, refuse to be a tool man.

Actually, this is just a little tool that can make operation including matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and inverse. More functions will be added later.

MATLAB is surely better than this project. Nevertheless, if you just want to finish your homework, a little exe of few megabytes is really enough. Isn't it?
